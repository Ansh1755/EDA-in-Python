# EDA-in-Python
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of analyzing and visualizing datasets to discover patterns, detect anomalies, test assumptions, and understand the data before applying machine learning models. This project demonstrates basic EDA techniques using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib/Seaborn

# Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook (optional

# What This EDA Covers

Loading a dataset
Checking shape, columns, and data types
 Handling missing values
 Summary statistics
 Univariate analysis (single variable)
 Bivariate analysis (relationships between variables)
 Correlation matrix
 Data visualization

 # Tips for Beginners
Always check for missing values before analysis.
Visualize each variable to understand its behavior.
Use pairplots to explore relationships between multiple variables.
Perform EDA before applying Machine Learning.

# Future Improvements

Add automated EDA report (pandas-profiling)
Handle outliers
Feature engineering
Time-series ED
